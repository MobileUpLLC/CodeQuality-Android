Gradle Plugin for integration of code quality tools with Gitlab CI.
It converts Detekt and Lint reports to compatible with [Gitlab Code Quality](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html) format.

## Usage

1) Add dependency
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'ru.mobileup:code-quality-android:1.2.0'
    }
}
```

2) Setup plugin
```
apply plugin: 'ru.mobileup.code-quality-android'

codeQuality {
    reportsDirectory = file('build/reports')
    issuesFile = rootProject.file('code_quality_issues.json')
    collectInformationIssues = false
}
```

3) Run your Detekt and Lint checks. Report file names for Detekt have to match "detekt\*.xml", and for Lint - "lint\*.xml".

4) Run `gradlew collectCodeQualityIssues`. 
Generated file (code_quality_issues.json) can be uploaded as [Gitlab Code Quality artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html#artifactsreportscodequality-starter).
